# Collect metrics about your linux server
This service helps to get metrics (CPU, RAM and PID of host) of your OS to console. 

You should install Docker on your local machine: https://www.docker.com/  

Clone from Github repository: https://github.com/SergeyZaika/metrics

There are three files: Dockerfile, metrics, readme.md. All files should be in the same directory on your local machine. Make sure youâ€™re in the directory.

To build: `docker build -t metrics:v1 .`

To run: `docker run -it --pid=host metrics:v1`

When container is started, run commands to get information:

`$ ./metrics cpu`

`$ ./metrics mem`

`$ ./metrics pid`
